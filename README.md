# Stack and Queue C++

# Requirements

For this assignment you will implement stacks and queues ADT using linked
lists with pointers only. A stack or a queue can be used to recognize a
certain types of patterns.

Consider the pattern STRING1#STRING2 where neither STRING1 and
STRING2 contains “#”.

Use stack ADT to determine whether or not the two strings are the same.
STRING1 and STRING2 are the same if they have the same number of
elements and the elements at the corresponding positions are the same.

Use queue ADT to determine whether or not STRING2 is reversed of STRING1.

The program displays a menu on the screen allowing the user to enter the
elements of stack or queue. The program terminates when the user enters 9.

Note :
• Size of stack and queue is determined by the number of the elements
entered.
• You are not allowed to use linked lists / stack / queue libraries. You
must implement all stack / queue classes functions and operations .
Use only one .cpp to define and implement classes , functions ,
implantations of functions and the driving program.
• You are not allowed to use arrays, vector arrays.
